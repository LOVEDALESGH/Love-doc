	<p class="p1"><b>Dr. Kwasi Aning believes vigilantism can be addressed if there is political will</b></p>
	<p>The lack of political will is the cause of growing vigilantism in Ghana, the Director of Faculty of Academic Affairs & Research at the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre has said.</p>

	<p>According to him, the chances of ending growing vigilantism in Ghana is about 5-10 percent.</p>

	<p class="p1">Dr. Kwasi Aning was responding to the call by the Inspector General of Police [IGP] at a press conference organized by the Ghana Police Service on Thursday to deal with the menace.</p>

	<p>The call by the GIP comes at a time government has set up a Commission of Inquiry to probe violence which marred the recent Ayawaso West Wougon by-elections allegedly carried out by pro-government vigilante groups who masked under the National Security apparatus.</p>
	<p>But Dr. Aning who spoke on the Joy FM Super Morning Show [SMS] holds that though the call by the Police Chief has the effect to “show authority and assuage public fear” it will amount to nothing without political will.</p>

	<p>What is political will?</p>
