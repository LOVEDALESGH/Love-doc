	<p>Thirteen days after politically-motivated violence captured national attention, former President Mahama wants the incident to capture international attention.</p>
	<p>He hosted diplomats at an interaction where videos and pictures of the violence on January 31, 2019, were shown to drum home the point, the Akufo-Addo government is presiding over national insecurity.</p>

	<p>Joined by the National Chairman, Samuel Ofosu Ampofo and General Secretary Johnson Asiedu Nketia of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), the Deputy Minority Leader James Avedzi, a former Minister for National Security Kofi Totobi Quakyi and senior members of the NDC, President Mahama was of the view that the actions of the vigilante group – which he said were under the instructions of the presidency - were criminal, and must be prosecuted.</p>

	<p>The briefing traced the history of the NPP’s introduction of the vigilante groups, their training and the dangerous decision to arm the hoodlums and also clothe them as supposed national security operatives. </p>
